# Catch95
This is a Web-Application which uses a ```CNN-Model``` to detect in real-time if a person is wearing his mask properly or not and if the type of mask he's wearing is N95 or not. This has wide range of applications- mostly for monitoring and gauging the risk levels at public places and raising an alarm to inform the authorities.

## How to get started with the Code:

### The following dependencies must be imported before running the code.
- ``` pip install opencv-python ```
- ``` pip install imutils ```
- ``` pip install keras ```
-  ``` pip install tensorflow ```
- Make sure that your device has access to a web-cam for the program to run. 

### After installing the above listed dependencies :
- Download the zip-file and extract the contents. 
- Add python and pip to your system path(if they are not already). Refer to this website if facing problems: https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/ 
- Open the anaconda powershell/ or cmd terminal if using Windows, navigate to the directory containing the filename "firstproj" and run ```python manage.py runserver``` to set-up the Django server.
- Open up Google Chrome and type in ```home:8000\``` or ```your IP:8000```. Catch95 is up and running!

OR

- Clone the github repo on to your computer typing ```!git clone https://github.com/ASHWarriors/Catch95.git``` on the Git Bash Terminal.
